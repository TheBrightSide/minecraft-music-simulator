## What's this?

This is a little Python program that can extract music from your Minecraft installation and simulate the music behaviour just like it's in the game. I've tried to make it as configurable as possible.

Feel free to look around my spaghetti code and comment.

## Installation & Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TheBrightSide/minecraft-music-simulator.git
cd minecraft-music-simulator
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup

- First you need to run
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Then you need to run `extractor.py` to extract the music files from your Minecraft installation (the version I recommend you to extract from is 1.16)
- Now you can run `main.py`

## Usage

- You can start the application from `main.py`
  ```sh
  py main.py
  ```
- You can extract the music files using `extractor.py` (recommended version: 1.16)
  ```sh
  py extractor.py
  ```
- You can configure the application from `options.json`
- `musicMapping.json` is the music files configuration.
- `leftover.json` (generated by the application) is a file that contains the current progression
